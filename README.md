# HackDayProject
At Hackday organised by </salt> where participants were tasked with writing a fullstack application in 24 hours. This project implements a Register/Log In screen where a user is able to create an account which gets stored in a database. To log in, a users data is also cross-referenced with data in the database and if it is correct a user is logged in. Logged in users have access to the Account screen that is unreachable by users that are not logged in. Finally, a user can delete their account, which deletes it from the database. The Hackday started 2023/03/16 and concluded 2023/03/17.

# Future Additions
In the future, I would like to hide the passwords, add proper authentication, handle log in state in a better way as well as add extra funcionality, like being able to log out, for example.
